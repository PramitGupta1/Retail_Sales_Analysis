This project on Retail Sales Analysis involved comprehensive data cleaning and preparation. Order dates were standardized for time-based analysis, numeric columns were corrected and missing values filled with medians, while categorical gaps were replaced with "Unknown". New features like Order_Month and Age_Group were created to uncover trends and customer behavior.

Analysis of revenue by product category revealed that a few categories dominate total sales, while others contribute minimally. This highlights the need for sharper product focus—promoting strong categories while reconsidering weak performers.

The monthly sales trend showed clear seasonality, with certain months experiencing revenue spikes likely due to festive seasons or promotions. Aligning inventory and marketing with these peaks can maximize impact.

Customer demographics revealed that male customers generated more revenue overall, though females remain significant. Age group analysis showed 25–34 and 35–44 as the highest spenders, making them the core revenue drivers. Younger (<25) and older (55+) customers spent less, suggesting opportunities for targeted strategies.

In terms of top products, certain SKUs consistently generated strong sales. Ensuring their stock availability, using upselling and bundling, and exploring premium positioning could further enhance performance.

From these insights, key recommendations include focusing on high-performing categories, synchronizing campaigns with seasonal peaks, targeting the 25–44 age group more aggressively, experimenting with strategies for underperforming segments, and maintaining strong inventory management for best-selling products.
